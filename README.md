This is a group capstone project for a Software Engineering class. I contributed towards creating the schedule page, which shows the schedule of the logged in user.
I also created the Create Schedule tab, which is accessible by "Manager" users who have higher permissions than regular users. In create schedule, a manager can create 
a specific users schedule by queueing certain times and dates they desire the user to work, and when it is finalized they can submit the schedule which will be updated 
in our database. I also helped with the LoginPage by implementing Firebase's REST API for user authentication. Finally, I created a SessionManager class, which allows
us to keep track of which User is logged in. This is used in many areas, including the Schedule page so the proper schedule is displayed to the right user.
